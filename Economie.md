Les principes d'économie et tables de prix sont tirés d'*Adventurer Conqueror King System* (ACKS). Il repose sur l'idée qu'un paysan de base consomme 1 pièce d'or par mois (1gp/m), et que les taux d'intérêt **mensuel** est de 3%. 

Les villes et villages sont catégorisés de I à VI, I ayant le marché le plus développé. Waterdeep est class I.
