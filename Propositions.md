| d%     | result                                                       |
| 01-50  | **Lost** - you lose the spell, but nothing else untoward occurs to you. |
| 51-70  | **Stunned**- you lose the spell and you may take no other actions this round. It’s +4 to hit you until your next initiative. |
| 71     | **Random** - a different, random spell of the same level is cast from your repertoire. |
| 72     | **Internalized** - you immediately take 1d4 damage. At the beginning of the your next initiative, make a Save vs. Spells or take an additional 1d4 damage. This continues each round until you successful make the saving throw. |
| 73     | **Target Self** - the spell instead targets you. If this would not otherwise result in a negative outcome, the spell instead does 1d6 damage per spell level to you. |
| 74     | **Target Ally** - as Target Self above, but instead, the spell targets a random ally within range. If there are no allies within range, then the spell targets you, as above. |
| 75     | **Explosion!** - a magical blast of energy erupts centered on you. It does 1d6 damage per spell level in a radius of 5’ per spell level. All within the radius, including you, may save vs. Blast & Breath for 1/2 damage. |
| 76     | **Spell Signature** - as the Overcast fails, you acquire a permanent side effect. Roll on the Spell Signatures Sub-Table (ACKS Player’s Companion, pg 110). |

| 80     | **Casting Slot Loss** - for one week, you temporarily loses a casting slot of the same level as the failed spell. For example, a 2nd-level Arcane caster can normally cast two 1st-level spells. For one week, the caster would be reduced to being able to cast only one 1st-level spell. |
| 81     | **No More Casting!**- you lose the ability to cast Arcane spells until you get 8 hours of uninterrupted rest. |
| 82     | **Strange Weather** - the weather within 1 mile per level of the spell radically changes for 1d4 (1-3) hours, (4-5) days, or (6) weeks per level of the spell. This can occur even if indoors or underground. See the Control Weather spell (ACKS, pg 74) for some possible side effects. |
| 83     | **Memory Loss** - you lose all memory of the last 1d4 (1-2) hours, (3-4) days, (5) weeks, or (6) years. |

| 86     | **Gone from Repertoire** - the spell is permanently lost from your Repertoire. |

| 88     | **Wasting Disease** - a horrible magical disease causes you to suffer -2 on all attack and Charisma throws, and reduces,your natural heal rate by half. You will die within 2d6 days unless a Cure Disease spell (ACKS, pg 74) is cast upon you. Non-magical attempts to cure the disease will fail. |
| 89     | **Permanent Dispel** - a permanent Dispel Magic spell (ACKS, pg 76) is cast on the area in a 5’/spell level radius centered on you. |
| 90     | **Turned to Stone** - you are turned to stone as per the spell, Flesh to Stone (ACKS, pg 77). No saving throw is allowed. |
| 91     | **Geas** - an extra-planar creature associated with the spell places a Geas upon you. No saving throw is allowed. Until the Geas is completed, you may no longer cast this spell. |
| 92     | **Void Hole** - a 5’ diameter tear in reality is summoned into the world in a random direction right next to you. Creatures,and their items must make a single Save vs. Paralysis to avoid being sucked into the tear and annihilated each time they are within 10’ of the hole, once per round. Inanimate matter that isn’t worn or held, that comes in contact with the hole, is automatically destroyed. The Void Hole moves 10’ in a random direction (d10 - start clockwise, a 9 or 10 indicates movement in the same direction) and (1-2) up, (3-4) same, or (5-6) lower elevation at the end of each hour. Only the power of a Wish ritual, or equivalent, can cause the Void Hole to be dispelled. |
| 93     | **Essence Drain** - the essence is drained out of everything within a 5’ radius per spell level. All living creatures must Savevs. Death or be aged 1d4 years per level of the failed spell. All flora within the radius withers and dies. All food within the radius spoils, and all water evaporates. |
| 94     | **Summon Monster** - the failed spell pulls a monster into the world in a random direction adjacent to you. The Judge chooses a monster with HD equivalent to that of the caster +2. The monster will attack, concentrating on you. |
| 95     | **Implosion** - you immediately implode and then explode in a disgusting shower of blood and gore. You’re dead. |
| 96-98  | **Mutated** - your body is magically mutated. Roll 2d10-1 on the Magical Mutations sub-table (ACKS Player’s Companion, pg 109). |

|       | Divine Calamity                                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| d%    | result                                                       |
| 01-25 | **Apathetic** - the Overcast spell is lost. Perhaps if you pray more fervently next time the spell will take hold? |
| 26-40 | **Unworthy?** - your prayers are barely worthy of attention. If you continue casting for another round, you will prove your worth and be heard. Should you choose to stop, your spell will be lost. |
| 41-44 | **Unconvinced** - the agents of your god have heard your plea, and are unconvinced. To convince them and cast the spell, take 1 hp of damage per spell level, or they remain unconvinced and you lose the Overcast spell. |
| 45-48 | **Beg** - someone’s not happy to hear from you today. Lose the spell unless you prostrate yourself and fervently beg for a miracle, losing any positive DEX bonus to AC until your next initiative. You will also need to use your movement to stand back up. |
| 49-52 | **Rebuked!** - you lose the spell and suffer a temporary loss of ability to cast spells for 1 round per level of the attempted spell. |
| 53-56 | **Rebuffed** - your prayers are rebuffed and you lose the spell. You may not attempt to cast this spell again until you have rested a full 8 uninterrupted hours and then prayed. |
| 57-60 | **Doubts Have Arisen** - though your spell succeeded, your effective level to turn/control undead is reduced by 1 per level of the spell for the next 24 hours. |
| 61-64 | **Castigation** - the spell succeeds, but your body is wracked with wounds equivalent to 1d4 damage per spell level. |
| 65-68 | **Offensive!** - you have offended your god. Sacrifice half the amount of the full experience it takes to get to your next level in gold within 24 hours. Example, a 1st-level Cleric would need to sacrifice the equivalent of 750 gold. Failure to make the sacrifice means that you will be subject to Divine Disfavor each time you cast a Divine Spell. This means that each time you cast a Divine spell, you roll a d20. On a throw of 1, you must roll on the Divine Disfavor table. After the 24 hours have passed without the proper sacrifice, only the full amount of experience in gold value sacrificed will remove this Disfavor. In the example above, this would be a sacrifice of the equivalent of 1,500 gold. If you are currently suffering from this Disfavor, roll again and keep rolling until you get a result of 69+. |
| 69-72 | **The Downward Spiral** - you are to be tested by the Downward Spiral. For the next 24 hours, any failed throw results in a cumulative -1 to the next throw of that type. For example, failing an attack throw results in a -1 to each subsequent attack throw until 24 hours have passed from the onset of this Disfavor. A second failed attack throw would now mean that your attacks are at -2, and so on. |
| 73-75 | **Prove Your Faith** - the spell succeeds, but for the next 24 hours, you may wear no armor, bear no shield, wield no weapon, nor use any magic item. You may only call upon the Divine spells of your god to assist you in battle. |
| 76-78 | **Enemy on the Other Side** - the spell succeeds, but the next throw you make on the Tampering with Mortality table(ACKS, pg 107) is at a -1 per level of the spell attempted for the d20 throw and a -1 on the d6 for the Side Effects Suffered throw. |
| 79-81 | **Vow of Silence** - the spell is cast, but it is the last thing that you must utter for 24 hours. During that time, you may not speak nor cast any spells. The Quiet Magic proficiency does not allow you to cast without speaking. Breaking this vow will result in the Judge being able to cause any one throw that you make in the future being an automatic failure, likely at the absolute worst time. |
| 82-84 | **Forsaken!** - the spell is lost and the misapplication of your deity’s power results in a Forsaken Sinkhole of Evil (ACKS, pg 251) forming, centered on you, with a 50’ per spell level radius. The misdirected energy of the spell immediately causes 1d6 Skeletons per spell level to erupt from the under the ground. These undead will attack the non-undead creatures closest to each of them. |
| 85-87 | **Mission from God** - the spell succeeds. However, you are placed under the effects of a Quest spell (ACKS, pg 84) by a representative of your deity equivalent to level 8+1d6. No initial save is allowed. The nature of the quest is up to the Judge, but it is always for the betterment of the faith, and often involves the return or destruction of some relic. |
| 88-90 | **Mark of Shame** - the spell fails. A Divine Mark has been placed upon you. All those who venerate your deity can see the Mark and will have no dealings with you. Clerics, Priests, Paladins, and the fervent of your faith might seek to do you harm, physical or otherwise. Enemies of your faith will only take 1/2 damage from you and receive a +2 to their saving throws vs. your spells. The Mark of Shame can only be removed when sacrifice something (or someone) of utmost personal value. The Judge will have the final say on if the sacrifice is worthy enough. |
| 91-93 | **Represent!** - the spell succeeds. You have one week to convert one new member to your faith per level of the spell. Only NPCs may be converted. Use the Reaction to Hiring Offer rules (ACKS, pg 49), with a result of “Accept” or better resulting in a success. Failure to convert enough new members within a week means that you suffer a temporary loss of one spellcasting and Turn Undead level per recruit that you came up short until you succeed. |
| 94-96 | **Something Slipped Through** - while the spell succeeds, the power used to cast the spell loosed an entity from its shackles and it has escaped into the world. It is now possessing a nearby creature and can pass from one creature to another through touch. It cannot possess you. It does not have to inhabit the body of a living creature and can exist without a host, though it has no powers of its own. It can fly and moves at a rate of 120’. It will seek to destroy you at the most inopportune moment, likely striking through someone close to you. A single Save vs. Death is allowed for anyone possessed to throw the entity out. It may not inhabit that person again if the throw is successful. |
| 97-99 | **Blue Bolt!** - you are smote on the spot, dropping immediately to 0 hit points. If and when you are brought back to life, by any means, even Reincarnation, you must roll on the Tampering With Mortality table (ACKS, pg 107) with a -10 to the d20 because you were killed instantly. Additionally, no one of your faith will bring you back to life because they too would suffer a Blue Bolt from your deity immediately upon attempting to do so. |
| 100   | **Death Comes** - at the behest of your deity, the shadowy servants of Death erupt from the ground and pull you body and soul into the Underworld. You are trapped there forever, unless someone can devise a means to rescue you. |
