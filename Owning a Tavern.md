#  <u>Owning a Taver</u>n

*The lords will say you need all sorts of things to set up a successful business. That's cockatrice eggs. They're just trying to keep you from becoming competition. You need just one thing to start your own tavern: gumption! It also doesn't hurt to have something you're known for, like an underground portal to riches and fame. A gimmick, I guess. So, that's gumption and a gimmick, which sometimes helps with naming the endeavor. Mine's pretty apparent, right? When I emerged from that hole in the ground with my earnings, there was nothing but cattlepie as far as the eye could see. I hired some folk and got to building. Hmm, I suppose that's three things; gumption, a gimmick, and gold. We'll call them the three G's.*

— Durnan, *Proprietor of the Yawning Portal*

## Basic Rules: Running Your Tavern

Your tavern makes money by selling food and beverages, but you must also spend money on running costs such as ingredients, wages, building maintenance, and guild fees. If more money comes in than goes out, you make a profit. If you spend more than you make, you end up with a loss.

To simulate the basic operation of your tavern, at the end of every tenday you must make a business results roll based on the overall quality of your tavern (i.e. Squalid to Aristocratic). Roll percentile dice and consult the Business Results table below to determine your profit or loss for that period. Your expenses are already factored into the result.

If your tavern makes a loss, you must pay that money out of your own purse. Conversely, any profit goes into your purse. If you're unable or unwilling to pay the loss, you must subtract that number from your next business results roll (after all, if you don't pay for basic expenses such as ingredients and wages, your business will soon collapse).

If you want to keep things simple, you can simply roll against the table every tenday. Unless your tavern is poor or squalid, you should find it turns a profit over time.

## Advanced Rules: Tavern Events

The following advanced rules enable you to actively manage the business through making decisions and dealing with random events. It enables you to turn a greater profit through superior business strategy.

Every tenday, roll once on the Tavern Events table before rolling on the Business Results table. You can make the following investments before you roll to mitigate certain results and improve your profit margins.

*Preventative Maintenance.* A sensible tavernkeeper invests a little extra to keep things shipshape and in good order. Spending 10 gp on extra maintenance may reduce other expenses later.

*Insurance.* Building insurance costs 10 gp and covers you against damage caused by fire, storms, floods, earthquakes, and subsidence.

*Extra Security.* Improving the safety of your patrons means hiring bouncers to help when you're busy. Spending 20 gp on extra security reduces risk to you and your patrons.

*Extra Service.* Hiring extra serving staff means your patrons receive better service and are more likely to come back. Spending 10 gp on extra service adds a +10 bonus to your next roll on the Business Results table.

**Tavernkeeper's Spotlight: The Yawning Portal**

The Yawning Portal is perhaps the most famous tavern in all the Forgotten Realms. Located in the Castle Ward of the city of Waterdeep, the establishment is named after the large well in its common room–the tip of a sunken stone tower–which descends into the mazelike dungeon of Undermountain. Treasure seekers from across the Realms meet in the inn's taproom to plan their own delves, making it the perfect place to start an adventure!

The Yawning Portal first featured in FR1: *Waterdeep and the North* (1987) by Ed Greenwood, creator of the Forgotten Realms.



**Trollskull Manor** starts with the following upgrades after renovation:

- Taproom (Cheap)
- Kitchen (Cheap)
- Larder (Cheap)
- Cellar (Cheap)
- Brewery (Cheap)

These upgrades give the establishment a starting valuation of 5, making it a Poor business. To make it shine, the characters need to invest more coin!

## Advanced Rules: Tavern Construction

The following rules allow you to upgrade your tavern using earnings from adventuring and business profits. Each new upgrade increases the overall valuation of your business and unlocks a new downtime activity for you to exploit between adventures.

Business Valuation

| Total Valuation | Quality      |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| 1-4             | Squalid      |
| 5-12            | Poor         |
| 13-19           | Modest       |
| 20-49           | Comfortable  |
| 50-69           | Wealthy      |
| 70+             | Aristocratic |

# <u>Buying Upgrades</u>

Upgrades have three costs that represent the level of luxury afforded. A cheap taproom has spit-and-sawdust floors, worn tables, and cracked mugs; whereas an expensive taproom would have polished floorboards and crystal glasses. Spending more on upgrades improves the overall valuation of your business and thereby increases your profits. If you improve an existing upgrade, you only pay the difference in cost between the two levels. For simplicities' sake, each upgrade takes a tenday to install and only one upgrade can be developed at a time.

To start your tavern business, all you need is a taproom (minimum 200 gp). Thereafter, each new upgrade has a prerequisite; for example, to construct a coach house you must first construct a stable. To value your business, add up your valuation score and consult the following table. The quality of your establishment determines which column you use when rolling on the Business Results table.

| Feature        | Prerequisite   | Downtime Activities   | Cost (gp)    | Valuation (based on cost) |
| -------------- | -------------- | --------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------- |
| Beer Engine    | Cellar         | Beer Festival         | 400/650/800  | +2/+4/+6                  |

Tavern Upgrades

The following upgrades are available for purchase.

**Beer Engine.** A beer engine is a mechanical apparatus that propels cask ale from the cellars to hand pumps at the bar. Invented by dwarves, these devices allow the busiest taverns to serve customers at greater speed.

**Beer Garden.** When the weather is fine, outside seating allows customers to escape the smoke and grime of the tavern interior. It also raises the respectability of your establishment.

**Brewery.** Brewing your own ale is a must if you want to escape the outlandish rates that private brewers charge. If your brew is good, you can even supply it to other taverns in your area!

**Cellar.** A stone-lined cellar allows you to stockpile wines and spirits at temperature and hold reserves of ale inside giant storage barrels.

**Coach House.** A coach house is the last word in lodging services, transforming your establishment into a full-blown coaching inn. This puts you on the map for wealthy customers traveling between settlements.

**Dancefloor.** A dancefloor fitted to your saloon bar or taproom lets your patrons revel late into the night and work up a profitable thirst! Its success depends on the quality of your minstrels, so it carries a considerable startup cost.

**Distillery.** A distillery allows you to distil your own brands of gin, rum, or whiskey, for sale on and off the premises. Fiery branded liquors are vital for raising your tavern's profile and boosting revenue.

**Feasting Hall.** If your fare is fine, investing in a dedicated seating area with table service is sure to open your establishment to the wealthier upper classes.

**Guest Bedrooms.** The presence of bedrooms transforms your humble tavern into an inn. Patrons can now use your establishment as a base to explore the region, turning over a steady stream of profit as they come and go.

**Kitchen.** All this drinking is sure to cook up an appetite in your customers! Providing food is the very first step to better service.

**Larder.** A storage area for wholefood supplies with a cool room for perishables. Any establishment looking to improve its fare should start with one of these.

**Lavatories.** Most taverns make do with an outhouse, ditch, or screened-off chamber pot for patrons to relieve themselves in. Building a lavatory indoors is the height of luxury and sure to make your tavern a talking point around town.

**Office.** An office provides a secure space to manage your business, containing a strongbox, writing desk, and a bookcase for ledgers and paperwork.

**Saloon Bar.** A separate bar for guests who are prepared to pay a little extra, with comfortable seating and table service. Saloon bars typically offer some form of entertainment to boot.

**Snug.** The snug, or "smoking room", is a private room for paying patrons. It's not solely the preserve of the rich: servants often pop into the snug for a cheeky drink while running errands in town.

**Stable.** Most taverns provide posts for hitching horses, but a dedicated stable provides extra security for patrons staying overnight. It's also an additional revenue stream: aside from basic stabling charges, patrons can pay extra for their horses to be fed and brushed down.

**Stage.** A stage is a raised platform for minstrels, storytellers and actors, typically nestled to one end of your saloon bar or taproom.

**Taproom.** The taproom is the heart of your tavern, containing your bar, a fireplace, and seating for your guests. Without this, you have no business!



# Advanced Rules: Downtime Activities

The following activities are unlocked by upgrades in the "Advanced Rules: Tavern Construction" section, but the DM can choose to allow them outside of those rules if you're not using them. Some of these activities assume you're using the investment rules from 'Advanced Rules: Tavern Events.'

Players must choose to invest their downtime as a group i.e. characters can't split up and spend downtime on separate activities simultaneously. Some activities can only be performed a limited amount of times per tenday, as specified under the "Frequency" header. Unless specified otherwise, each day of downtime that you spend working on these activities adds +1 to your next roll on the Business Results table.

#### Barbecue Season

**Frequency:** Unlimited **Prerequisite:** Beer Garden

The spring and summertime months are perfect for outside cooking: a spit roast perhaps, or sausages chargrilled over coals. Each day that you spend on this activity grants a +2 bonus to your next roll on the Business Results table. Due to the risk of fire, double any losses that you accrue unless you've also paid for insurance.

#### Banquet

**Frequency:** 1/tenday **Prerequisite:** Feasting Hall

Laying on a banquet for the crust of society requires careful sourcing of fine food and wines. Each banquet you host takes a day to prepare and costs 10 gp to finance. After engaging in this activity, roll percentile dice on the Banqueting table to determine the success or failure of your event.

| [[/r d100]] | Result                                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 01-10       | Huzzah! Your event attracts an important figure from your local community. Unfortunately, they die the next day due to food poisoning. You're fined 3d10 x 10 gp and take a -15 penalty to your next roll on this table and a -25 penalty to your next roll on the Business Results table. |
| 11-20       | That special course you fervently promoted turns out to be infested with lice and you're forced to serve meatloaf instead. You take a -15 penalty to your next roll on the Business Results table. |
| 21-40       | One of your guests drinks too much and causes a scene. Roll a d6. On a 1-3, the guest blurts out a secret that could prove useful. The DM determines the nature of this revelation. On a 4-5, the argument gives your event a bad name and you suffer a -10 penalty to your next roll on this table. On a 6, your guest chokes on their vomit and returns to haunt your tavern as a phantatox (see appendix C). |
| 41-80       | You earn the favor of an influential figure from your local community. Choose a background: once in the next year, you can call in a favor with the figure to gain the benefit of the feature assigned to their background. |
| 81-90       | Your event is a roaring success and your guests shower you with tips. Your business gains 3d10 x 5 gp and you gain a +10 bonus to your next roll on the Business Results table. |
| 91-00       | This wondrous feast couldn't have gone better. You gain the benefit of both entries listed above this one (41-90). |

#### Beer Festival

**Frequency:** 1/tenday **Prerequisite:** Beer Engine

Celebrate local brewers by featuring their casks in a festival of beer drinking. This activity takes a day of downtime to prepare. Roll up to 6d6 (one for each guest beer) and add the result of the roll to your next roll on the Business Results table.

However, heavy drinking invites damage. If you didn't take out preventative maintenance and extra security, you receive a repair bill equal to the sum of any matching dice you roll (e.g. rolling three 4's yields a repair bill of 12 gp).

#### Brew Beer

**Frequency:** No more than 5 concurrent batches **Prerequisite:** Brewery

Brewing your own ale is a sure-fire way to turn extra profits, assuming your brew is good. Each day that you spend on this activity costs you 1 gp in ingredients (e.g. bitters, fruit, spices, coffee beans, etc). Note down the brew date and any special ingredients you included. Exactly 40 days later, roll on the Brewing Beer table to determine the results.

| [[/r d100]] | Result                                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 01-10       | Yikes! Something went wrong with the fermentation and a dangerous mold formed on the surface. (DC<5) |
| 11-20       | Ugh. Looks like you used contaminated yeast for this batch and all following batches. Any batches still fermenting are ruined.(DC<10) |
| 21-40       | Not bad, but something's not quite right. Roll a d6. On a 1-3, the brew is just okay, and you turn no profit on it. On a 4-6, it's serviceable and your business earns 1d8 x 5 gp from selling it.(DC<15) |
| 41-80       | It's a fine, fine brew. Your business earns 2d8 x 5 gp from selling it.(DC<20) |
| 81-90       | Perfection! Your business earns 4d8 x 5 gp from selling this brew. Reroll any 1s you roll.(DC<25) |
| 91-00       | You doubt you'll ever brew anything to equal this again. It's heaven in a glass. Your business earns 6d8 x 5 gp from selling the brew, but you can't use any downtime activities during the next tenday as you're too busy enjoying your own wares.(DC<30) |

#### Dance Night

**Frequency:** 1/tenday **Prerequisite:** Dancefloor

Turning your tavern into a dancehall improves your revenue but takes work. Each dance you host takes a day to prepare. After engaging in this activity, roll percentile dice on the Dance Night table to determine the success or failure of your event.

| [[/r d100]] | Result                                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 01-10       | The dance ends in disaster as a brawl breaks out between revelers. Pay 1d8x10 gp for repairs, minus 40 gp if you paid for extra security. You take a -15 to penalty to your next roll on the Business Results table. |
| 11-20       | Your headline band fails to show so you make do with the support act. Unfortunately, they suck. You take a -10 penalty to your next roll on the Business Results table. |
| 21-40       | Your dance attracts the attention of some local hoods, who insist you pay them to provide "security" for your next dance night. The DM determines the gang involved. Until you settle the dispute, you must pay 1d6x10 gp to roll on this table. |
| 41-80       | Your dance is a great success. Your business gains 2d8 x 5 gp. |
| 81-90       | Your dance gets a positive write up in a local newsprint. Your business gains 4d8 x 5 gp and you gain a +20 bonus to your next roll on this table when using the same ingredients. |
| 91-00       | Your once-in-a-lifetime event is spoken about for years to come. Gain 6d8 x 5 gp and a +20 bonus to your next roll on the Business Results table. |

#### Distilling Spirits

**Frequency:** No more than five concurrent batches **Prerequisite:** Distillery

Distilling your own gin or rum puts your business on the map and earns a tidy profit from other taverns in your area. Each day that you spend on this activity costs you 1 gp in ingredients (e.g. herbs, spices, fruit peel, etc). Note down the date of concoction and any special ingredients you included. Exactly 40 days later, roll on the Distilling Spirits table to determine the results.

| [[/r d100]] | Result                                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 01-10       | You've made concentrated methanol. Luckily for your patrons, you identify your mistake before bottling it. Not so lucky for you: make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If you fail the save, you're blinded until cured by a @Item[088J3mju80dV8JOn]{lesser restoration} spell or similar magic. |
| 11-20       | Boom! Your still explodes! Nobody's hurt, but your repair bill comes to 3d10 x 5 gp unless you took out insurance. |
| 21-40       | Your concoction is potable but too strong for most palates. Roll a d6. On a 1-3, this batch doesn't sell so well, earning only 1d10 x 5 gp. On a 4-6, you hawk it to the dwarves and earn 3d10 x 5 gp. |
